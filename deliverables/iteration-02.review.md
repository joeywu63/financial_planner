# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 2019 Nov 13
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 1. Weekly meetings: consistent, and helpful for keeping members on track.
 2. Using slack for communication: the different channels have been helpful for organizing work topics.
 3. Having two people review code before merging into master: good for assuring quality of code.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 1. Meistertask: planned to use for organizing tasks, did not end up being used very often.
 2. Roles: the specific roles don't match with our workflow at this point (implementing basic functionalities).

#### Planned changes

 None

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 Cost breakdown on the calculator page: we hit the maximum number of reads to our FireBase for that day, so we couldn't access to the database, which was needed to work on this task.

#### How was your product demo?
 
 We prepared for our demo by planning who would demo which parts and testing it ourselves before demo-ing to our partners. We were able to demo the basic functionalities: Profile page (editing profile and password), calculator page (being able to see the cost of expenses and select expenses), admin page (), login page. Our partners were satisfied with the progress made so far. They mentioned that the order of the calculator headers needed to be changed to fit their requirements. During the demo, our partners were very open to any possible additional features we suggested, but we realized that implementing all of them would be excessive work for us. Through this, we learned how to manage expectations and set better internal deadlines for ourselves. We also learned how to explain our work to people who don't have technical backgrounds.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
 1. Last iteration, we focused on basic functionality. This iteration, we will also focus on usability.
 2. Since we're working in subteams for separate pages, there needs to be more communication *between* the subteams as well as within them.
 3. We need to utilize our MeisterTask board in order to get a better vision or our tasks.
 4. We might have to cut features.
