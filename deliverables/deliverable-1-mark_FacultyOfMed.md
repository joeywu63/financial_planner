### Feedback

#### Product
- Q1: Great that you have mockups & good explanation
- Q4: Great list of benefits, very thorough, evident that you did your research and that you understand the advantages of your product
- Q5: 
    - You don't have to include high level design details (i.e. that the interface should be intuitive) when writing user stories
    - You can potentially break down some of your user stories into smaller user stories 
        - For instance, logging in as an application admin can be separate from making changes in the system
        - Creating surveys and viewing results can also be two different user stories

### Process
- Artifacts: Provide a link to your task management platform

### Overall Quality
- Didn't remove instructions at the beginning, in the artifacts and highlight sections (there should be no templates) 
- Missing some headers 
- Try to reduce the use of too many bullet points and subheadings (i.e. in user stories section)
