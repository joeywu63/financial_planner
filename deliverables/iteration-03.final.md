# FINANCIAL PLANNER FOR CANADIAN MED-SCHOOL APPLICANTS

## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Nov 22, 2019
 * End date: Dec 1, 2019

### Changes from you `product.md`

List the most significant changes you made to your product (if any). It's normal to change features mid-project or reduce the scope to meet timelines. 

 * Start with the most significant change
 * Identify either a change in features or a reduction of your original scope
 * For each change, explain why you are making it and what you are hoping to achieve from it

 > *Note:* If you are not making (or haven't made) any changes to your product, it means you successfully scoped, planned and executed the development of your application.This is a very rare occurrence - describe what you believed enabled your team to do so and why. 

### Handoff plan

Describe your plan for handing off your product and all technical assets to your partner

 * Will you have a handoff meeting? If so, what will be discussed?
 * What assets/artifacts will you be handing off to your partner (e.g. codebase, deployment tools, running application, task tracker, etc.)? 
 * How will you hand off these assets/artifacts?
 * Does your partner have the technical capacity to manage/maintain/develop your product? How will that impact how you handoff the product?

We will have a final meeting with our partners to handoff the product. In this meeting we will discuss:
- Providing access to the codebase, and to the Firebase project we've created. Also how to give access to possible future developers.
- Ensure our partners are aware of where to find the instructions to setup and deploy the project for possible future developers.
- Provide a list of tasks that we weren't able to fully get to. This will give our partners a good idea as to where the product stands.
- TODO: Last question

> *Note:* This is one of the most important aspects of the project. Please consult with your partner, your TA and the instructors on how to successfully execute this.
