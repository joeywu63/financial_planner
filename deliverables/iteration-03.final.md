# FINANCIAL PLANNER FOR CANADIAN MED-SCHOOL APPLICANTS

## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Nov 22, 2019
 * End date: Dec 1, 2019

### Changes from you `product.md`

List the most significant changes you made to your product (if any). It's normal to change features mid-project or reduce the scope to meet timelines. 

 * Start with the most significant change
 * Identify either a change in features or a reduction of your original scope
 * For each change, explain why you are making it and what you are hoping to achieve from it

 > *Note:* If you are not making (or haven't made) any changes to your product, it means you successfully scoped, planned and executed the development of your application.This is a very rare occurrence - describe what you believed enabled your team to do so and why. 

### Handoff plan

Describe your plan for handing off your product and all technical assets to your partner

 * Will you have a handoff meeting? If so, what will be discussed?
 * What assets/artifacts will you be handing off to your partner (e.g. codebase, deployment tools, running application, task tracker, etc.)? 
 * How will you hand off these assets/artifacts?
 * Does your partner have the technical capacity to manage/maintain/develop your product? How will that impact how you handoff the product?

For the project handoff, we plan to have a final meeting with our partners to discuss what we will
be handing off and how they can maintain and develop the product in the future. In this meeting we will discuss:

- Providing access to the codebase. We plan to create a private repository with our codebase on
GitHub, which we will provide our partners access to, and allow them to invite others as they see
fit. This also includes our readme file which outlines how new developers can set up the project locally.
- Providing access to our Firebase project, which stores all data for this project and doubles
as the deployment tool we use. Similar to above, we will add them as collaborators and allow them
to invite others as they see fit. 
- Ensuring our partners are aware of the tools, resources and instructions to set up the project locally and deploying it. These resources include our readme file, relevant Firebase guides (such as [local testing/deployment](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/deploying)), and tools to set up the project locally (such as [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)).
- Ensuring our partners know how to connect our Firebase-hosted site to a custom domain, which
they have mentioned interest in doing in the future. We will provide them with the relevant Firebase
[guide] (https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/custom-domain) as a resource for this purpose
- Providing access to our task log on [MeisterTask](https://www.meistertask.com/app/project/bAdrMRN9/csc301) by inviting them as collaborators. Prior to the meeting we will populate the backlog with any lingering minor tasks and features that were cut/reduced to fit the scope. This allows our partners to better understand the features we have completed and delivered, as well as any outstanding tasks, issues or bottlenecks that could be optimized in the future.
- Providing our partners with points of contact after the project has been handed off. We will provide contact information for several group members that our partners can reach out to should
they encounter any technical difficulties with the project.

Prior to the handoff meeting, we will request our partners invite any individual(s) that will
be managing/maintaining/developing the product after the handoff. If any are present, we will 
go over the structure of our codebase briefly and discuss the above points in more technical detail.
If none are present (as has been the case for all regular partner meetings), we will simply go through the above points at a higher, more abstract level, and place more emphasis on the resources
available and how/where to access them.

Finally, we will provide our partners with a document or e-mail that summarizes all key points discussed during the meeting, links to key resources as well as our contact information, so all
relevant information can be referenced in one place.
