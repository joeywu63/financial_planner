#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

**Group Communications**:

We are using the Slack app for general communications. Team members are expected to check for new messages on the app at least once per day. The Slack workspace is divided into channels for organization.

For voice or video calls, we will use Facebook or Zoom.

**Partner Communications**:

The main line of communication with the partner is through email, such as to provide updates on the project or arrange meetings. Our team representative will email the partner on behalf of the team, cc-ing the rest of the team members.

Once every 2 weeks, there will be an in-person meeting with the partner.

**Meetings**:

Team members are responsible for attending the weekly meetings. We will allow some lenience for hectic schedules, but if a team member repeatedly misses meetings, we will go to the TA. At the meetings, we will have a time where we take turns talking about our progress from the previous week. If we could not complete tasks we were responsible for (tracked through meistertask), we will look at the causes. If it is due to unexpected technical challenges, we will take it into account in workload estimates of future tasks. Then we will have take time to prioritize and assign tasks for the preceeding week.

**Conflict Resolution**:
 
 Below are several hypothetical scenarios/conflicts that may arise, and how we will resolve them.

   * There is disagreement on how to accomplish a task (technical implementation, scope etc.): In one of the weekly meetings, we would have a discussion about the strengths of each option. Then, we would take a vote. If a team member still feels strongly about the result, we would repeat the discussion process.
   * There is a task nobody wants to take on: If the task is large, we would subdivide it among the team. Otherwise, we would access the strengths and weakness of each member to decide who would have the easist time accomplishing the task. At the same time, we would make sure such "undesirable" tasks do not always go to the same person.
   * A team member is writing poor quality code: In one of the weekly meetings, we would discuss what we find lacking and offer suggestions to improve the quality of the code.
   * A team member is non-responsive/not contributing at all: If a team member is irresponsive, they will be told of the issue. If it becomes persistent, we will report to the TA.


#### Events

**Meetings**:

The team will have meetings once per week, on Fridays at 12 pm to 1 pm at Bahen, unless it has been decided that we will not be meeting that week, or that we have a partner meeting that week.

The team will have online voice call meetings as necessary, for more urgent conversations or when it is more convenient than an in-person meeting.

The purpose of team meetings is to keep everyone up-to-date on the state of the project, to assign new tasks for the upcoming week, and to review completed work.

Two members of the team will be expected to complete code reviews for each Pull Request. We will also hold quick online sync meetings when necessary.


#### Partner Meetings

**Meeting Descriptions**:

**_Meeting 1_**  
**Time and Location**  
Friday, Nov 1, 12-1pm @ David Naylor Building room 314

//TODO: Wendy will add minutes for the meeting before 11:59pm Nov 11

**_Meeting 2_**  
**Time and Location**  
Friday, Nov 15, 12-1pm @ David Naylor Building room 314

#### Artifacts   

 * The team will be utilizing MeisterTask, a task management platform for teams.
 * We will use MeisterTask to assign, organize and prioritize tasks between team members.
 * We will also use MeisterTask to keep track of outstanding items that are not yet done.
 * We will utilize MeisterTask's ability to assign deadlines for items which aids in keeping team members on schedule for deliverables.
 * The team will prioritize tasks by keeping them in an ordered list as well as adding highlight tags to each, stating whether they are of high, medium or low priority.
 * Tasks will be assigned to team members according to their experience, priority and schedules. 


#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
